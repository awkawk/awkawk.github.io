				<h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is being chartered as an early update to the existing <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/09/wcag-charter">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group charter</a>. As indicated in the current charter, the Working Group has been developing <span class="change">extensions to address gaps in WCAG 2.0</span><span class="delete">new work in the areas of mobile accessibility, low vision accessibility, and cognitive accessibility</span>. While it has proved useful to be developing proposals for new criteria in focused task forces, following additional discussion in the WCAG WG and W3C member company and public feedback, we believe that it will be more beneficial to develop these as a combined <span class="change">recommendation</span><span class="delete">normative guidance</span> in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 <span class="change">rather than as separate extensions</span>. Specifically, the group has received feedback that the existence of multiple separate <span class="change">recommendations</span><span class="delete">normative specifications</span> (as extensions) risks deharmonization of global accessibility guideline use and increases the likelihood of conflicts <span class="change"> between specifications due to the recommendations not being developed together</span><span class="delete">between these separate documents</span>. As a result, the Working Group is now seeking to recharter in order to produce a WCAG 2.1 Recommendation.</p>
				<p>The <span class="change">WCAG 2.1 recommendation will address gaps in WCAG 2.0 related to content and</span><span class="delete">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 document</span> will incorporate updated <span class="change">Success Criteria to address content viewed on small display sizes and used with touch and stylus-based input modalities - features particularly common for mobile devices. WCAG 2.1 will also incorporate updated Success Criteria related to content and digital publications accessed by people with low-vision and with cognitive disabilities.</span><span class="delete">guidance to better address topics including low-vision and cognitive disabilities and to incorporate guidance to support mobile use cases and touch interfaces.</span> The Working Group has conducted research and initial development for these topics in task forces and expects to reach FPWD in February 2017.</p>
				<p>The WCAG 2.1 update will be an incremental update to WCAG 2.0 rather than a major revision. WCAG 2.1 is designed to build on the WCAG 2.0 recommendation to ensure testability and technology independence, and will also ensure backward compatibility with WCAG 2.0. As with WCAG 2.0 in the past, the Working Group will periodically conduct reviews and provide feedback on WCAG 2.1 support materials created by other groups to help ensure that resources reflect the intent of the <span class="change">recommendation</span><span class="delete">specification</span>.</p>
				<p>The Working Group intends to produce updated guidance for accessibility on a regular interval, starting with WCAG 2.1. Depending on the outcome of the requirements development for the next major update to WCAG, it may be necessary to pursue further dot-releases of WCAG until a major release is ready to be completed in time for a scheduled release date.</p>
				<p>Improving support for testing WCAG is an important priority for the Working Group. The AG WG has an Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force which is developing a framework and repository of test rules to promote a unified interpretation of WCAG among different web accessibility test tools. The proposed recommendation-track framework will be generic enough to meet the needs of WCAG 2.0 but not exclude other standards, including WCAG 2.1. The framework will also allow the development of custom test rules to meet company requirements and best practices. This includes test rules for fully automated and semi-automated conformance testing in different web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and WAI-ARIA. While this framework will add a layer of implemention for tool developers, it provides more consistency and comparability of the resulting test rules.</p>
                <p>In addition to WCAG 2.1, and as a result of the research conducted in the various task forces and the experiences working with WCAG 2.0 for several years, a substantial evolution of WCAG is also needed to <span class="change">account for the complex interdependencies of content and user agent capabilities and to improve the usability of the specification.</span><span style="text-decoration:line-through">integrate guidance for content and user agents, and to address authoring tool requirements as an essential part of the process for delivering accessible information.With the closure of the User Agent and Authoring Tools Working Groups in the past year, many participants of these groups have joined the current WCAG Working Group in order to participate in the various task forces and have made the need for a major update clear.</span><span class="change">This incubation work is lower priority than the primary deliverable (WCAG 2.1).</span> The requirements for the next major version will be defined in parallel with (and are substantially informed by) the development of WCAG 2.1.</p>

			<section class="participation">
				<h2 id="participation"> Participation </h2>
				<p> To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 15 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key <span class="change">implementers</span> of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute <span class="change">four hours</span> per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants. </p>
                <p class="change">Key implementers of WCAG (desktop and non-desktop environments) include Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.), Web authoring tool developers, Web accessibility evaluation tool developers, user agent tool developers, and people with disabilities.</p>
				<p> The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>. </p>
				<p> The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>. </p>
			</section>

			<section id="communication">
				<h2> Communication </h2>
				<p id="public"> Technical discussions for this Working Group are <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however. </p>
				<p> Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group home page.</a>
				</p>
				<p> Most Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis. </p>
				<p> This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-wai-gl@w3.org">public-wcag-gl@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-gl/">archive</a>) or on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work. </p>
				<p> The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion. </p>
			</section>

			<section id="decisions">
				<h2> Decision Policy </h2>
				<p> At charter time, the decision policy is under review within the group in order to develop a decision process that supports greater asynchronous participation and minimizes dependence on weekly teleconferences. Until completed, the Working Group decision policy is as explained in Process Document <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3 of the W3C Process Document</a>.</p>
				<p>The <span class="change">Working</span> Group maintains specific procedures to establish and measure consensus and address objections in the <a href="/WAI/GL/decision-policy">AG Working Group Decision Policy</a>.</p>

				<!--          <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the (Working|Interest) Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
