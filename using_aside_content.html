<h1>Animal Rescue of Greater Boston</h1>  
    <article>
  <p>Some of our services include, taking animals into our   shelter who are mistreated and abused.  
Many people come and visit us also to look for an animal to care for, like this testimonial from a happy 
family who brought home a puppy shows.</p>

  <aside>
   <q> Alice (May 6th): We are so glad we visited the Animal Sanctuary, and brought home little Puddles.
       He is such a good puppy! </q>

  <p>Without the help and support of people like that we would never be able to do what we do</p>
